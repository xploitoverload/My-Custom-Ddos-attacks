# üí£ UDP Flooding Tool ‚Äî ddos.c
## Developed by [Kalpesh Solanki](https://kalpeshsolanki.me)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: 
This code performs a UDP flood attack and is intended for educational and ethical testing ONLY.
Unauthorized use against networks is ILLEGAL under most jurisdictions (e.g., Computer Misuse Act, CFAA, etc.).

# üìÑ Description
This C program launches a UDP flood attack on a target IP and port for a specified duration using multiple threads. Each thread sends predefined payloads continuously until the time is up.

# üß† Features
- UDP socket-based flooding.
- Customizable IP, port, duration, and number of threads.
- Multi-threaded using POSIX pthread.
- Statically linked binary.

# üîß Compilation
Use the following `gcc` or `g++` command to compile:
```bash
gcc ddos.c -o fuck -lz -lpthread -static
```
or
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 ddos.cpp -o fuck -pthread
```

- lpthread: Link pthreads for multithreading.
- lz: Links zlib (even if unused, if required by platform).
- static: Produce a statically linked binary (larger but self-contained).

# üöÄ Usage
```bash
./fuck <IP> <PORT> <TIME> <THREADS>
```
## Example
```bash
./fuck 192.168.1.100 80 10 100
```
This will flood 192.168.1.100:80 for 10 seconds using 100 threads.

# üßµ Threading

Each thread sends all payloads in a loop until the time runs out. Threads are joined after completion to ensure clean exit.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Warning

- DO NOT use this tool against:
- Servers you do not own
- Networks without permission
- Public IPs

Use this only on authorized test environments (e.g., your own lab setup).

# üìú Output Example
```text
Flood started on 192.168.1.100:80 for 10 seconds with 100 threads
(XPLOITOVERLOAD)Attack with ID: 139943589336832
...
Attack finished Made By @Kalpesh Solanki
```
# üßπ Cleanup
No special cleanup required. The socket is closed and memory is freed.
